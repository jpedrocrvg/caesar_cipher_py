# Caesar Cipher For Python

This Python script provides a Caesar cipher implementation for message encryption and decryption. Users can choose between 'encode' and 'decode', input their message, and define the shift amount for the cipher.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script.
2. Choose 'encode' or 'decode'.
3. Enter your message when prompted.
4. Input the desired shift number.
5. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

Feel free to use, modify, and experiment with this script for your cryptographic needs. Enhance your messages with a touch of encryption using the Caesar cipher!
